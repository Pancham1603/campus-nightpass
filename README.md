## Campus NightPass

### Project Description
This project aims to develop a Campus NightPass System for Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala,  enhancing the access and management of on-campus resources during late hours. The system will allow students to request and obtain permission to leave their hostels after 08:30 pm for academic purposes by booking available seats in laboratories, libraries, and discussion rooms on a first-come, first-served basis. To ensure security and accountability, the system will also provide a robust verification process for students checking in and out of these facilities.

### Project Objectives
- Enable students to book late-night permissions for academic purposes in on-campus facilities.
- Implement a secure and efficient identity verification process for students.
- Provide real-time tracking of student check-in and check-out activities.
- Alert security personnel in case a student is checked out but not checked in within 20 minutes.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Project Scope

The Campus NightPass System will include the following key features:

1. **Profile Management**
   - Profile information will include student ID, contact details, and a scanned photo for biometric verification.

2. **Late Night Permission Booking**
   - Students can book available seats in on-campus facilities.
   - Booking can be made on a first-come, first-served basis.
   - Each booking location will have an upper limit.
   
3. **Verification Mechanism** 
   - Two methods of verification: Manual Verification and Face Biometric Verification.
   - Manual Verification: Security personnel can manually verify student data upon scanning the permission code.
   - Face Biometric Verification: Security personnel can use their phone camera for biometric verification.
   
4. **Check-In and Check-Out System**
   - Upon successful verification, students will be marked as 'Checked Out.'
   - Upon arrival at their destination, students will be marked as 'Checked In.'
   - If the student doesn't check in within 20 minutes after checking out, an alert is sent to security personnel.
   
5. **Security Personnel Dashboard**
   - Security personnel will have access to a dashboard displaying student permissions, check-in/check-out activities, and last activity records.

## Benefits and Expected Outcomes

The Campus NightPass System will provide the following benefits:

- Improved management of on-campus resources during late hours.
